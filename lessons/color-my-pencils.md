So to change your `colorscheme` what should you do?

If you answered "Help Menu!" you are a fantastic!  Please execute `h:
colorsc<tab><Cr>`

try executing the following

```
:colorscheme <C-d>
```

Pick anything that autocompletes!  Much like set options, it will only persist
for this vim session.  Writing it to your vimrc and open up file you commonly
edit and behold the beauty!

These are not the only colorschemes that you can have.  Plenty of plugins
provide many more.

## Recap
Ok.  This is probably getting a bit overwhelming.  A lot of this comes with
practice and as you use this it becomes second nature.

I'll say it again.
* This is a journey, its not a day trip
* The journey is uphill
* The top of the mountain is incredible

### What we learned
* Using the help menu. 
    * navigating the all the set options.
    * Using tab and <C-d>
    * Arrows vs <C-p> and <C-n>

* Set options
    * The power to control how our editor operates through sets.

* Colorschemes
    * How to set them and peruse them.

* We learned things about motions.
    * dd can become <count>dd
    * Moving with 10j / 10k.  Wowow

### Extend it
Do you think you could do anything with `y` and `p`?  Could `yj` work?  What
does it do?  Why?  What about `5p`?  What do you think happens?  Why?

### Foundation
We have built the foundation.  You know about customizing your vim experience
and you know how to basically move around.  The only thing left is really
optimizing!  And there is practically an infinite amount of optimizing!
