## Before you do
* Navigate to an empty directory (create your own).  We will be doing a bit of
  editing.

* Ensure you have no vim rc active.
  * If you are using vim, rename ~/.vimrc -> ~/.vimrc2
  * If you are using nvim, rename ~/.config/nvim/init.vim -> ~/.config/nvim/init.vim2

### Exercises
We will be using curl to grab a few exercises throughout this class.  Here is
an example.

#### Note
Notice that i name the downloaded file then `&& vim name`

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamzrob/vim-course/main/lessons/exercise-0-hjkl.md > exercise.md && vim exercise.md
```

So you are in an empty directory, lets do this! Simply type `vim` and press
enter.  (Ensure you have no vim rc)
